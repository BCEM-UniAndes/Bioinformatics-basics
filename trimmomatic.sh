# Script for running Trimmomatic automatically for all the files in a direactory named reads-raw. Text file .txt with the IDs from the samples is required.
# This script is customized for pair-end reads. It assumes that for each senquenced sample, the only difference between the names of the forward and revserse files is _R1 and _R2 respectively
# Clean reads are stored in a directory called clean-reads
